# Querying Data

Records and analyses share the same interface and functionality for browsing:

This includes:

- A search bar, for basic substring matching against visible fields.
- The `Filter` panel, for adding more complicated filters against visible, non-visible and nested fields.
- The `Summarise` panel, for computing the number of items per summary group specified by the selected fields.
- The :material-content-copy: `Copy CLI Command`, for copying the current filters and summary fields to a command for the Onyx command-line interface.
- The results panel, titled either `Records` or `Analyses`, that displays results matching the current query. Here, results can be re-ordered and navigated, as well as exported via the table `Options` dropdown.
- The `Edit Columns` button, for changing the columns returned in the results.

We will now learn how to filter, aggregate and export data using this interface.
